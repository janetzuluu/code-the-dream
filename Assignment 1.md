**Assignment: Python Basics - Data Conversion, User Input, Error Handling, and Functions**

**Objective:** In this assignment, you will practice Python programming concepts such as data type conversion, user input handling, error handling, and creating functions. Complete the tasks below, modifying the provided code where needed and adding your own implementations.

### **Task 1: Data Type Conversion**
1. **String to Integer Conversion**
   - Convert the variable `num_str` (a string representing a number) to an integer.
   - Perform arithmetic using the converted integer and another variable `age`.
   - Print the result.

2. **Float to String Conversion**
   - Convert the variable `height` (a float) to a string.
   - Concatenate the float value as a string with another string (e.g., " meters").
   - Print the result.

3. **Integer to Float Conversion**
   - Convert the variable `age` (an integer) to a float and print the result.

### **Task 2: Simple Calculator**
1. **User Input**
   - Ask the user to enter two numbers (`num1` and `num2`).

2. **Perform Arithmetic Operations**
   - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the two numbers.
   - Handle the case where the user attempts to divide by zero and print an appropriate error message.

3. **Print Results**
   - Print the results of the arithmetic operations.

### **Task 3: Grading System**
1. **User Input for Score**
   - Ask the user to enter their score (as a float value).

2. **Determine Grade**
   - Use conditional statements to assign a grade based on the score:
     - **A**: 90 and above
     - **B**: 80-89
     - **C**: 70-79
     - **D**: 60-69
     - **F**: below 60

3. **Print Grade**
   - Print the grade assigned.

### **Task 4: Function to Calculate Average**
1. **Create a Function**
   - Create a function called `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.

2. **Calculate and Return Average**
   - The function should calculate and return the average of the numbers in the list.
   - If the list is empty, return 0.

3. **Test the Function**
   - Test the function with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and print the result.

### **Task 5: Calculator with Error Handling**
1. **Create a Function for Division**
   - Create a function called `divide_numbers` that takes two arguments (`num1` and `num2`).

2. **Implement Error Handling**
   - Use a `try-except` block to handle division by zero and return an appropriate error message.

3. **Test the Function**
   - Ask the user to input two numbers, call the `divide_numbers` function, and print the result.

### **Submission:**
Submit your completed Python code, including all tasks, in a `.py` file or a Jupyter notebook. Make sure to include comments explaining your code where necessary.
