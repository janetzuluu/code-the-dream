Assignment: Python Data Conversion, User Input, and Error Handling

Objective: In this assignment, you will practice data type conversions, user input handling, and implementing functions with error handling in Python. Complete the tasks below, modifying the provided code where needed and adding your own implementations.

Task 1: Data Type Conversions

String to Integer Conversion

You have a string variable num_str that represents a number (e.g., "50"). Convert it to an integer and perform arithmetic with another variable called age (an integer). Print the result.

Float to String Conversion

Convert a float variable height to a string. Print the float value as a string and concatenate it with another string, such as " meters".

Integer to Float Conversion

Convert an integer variable age to a float and print the result.

Task 2: Simple Calculator with User Input

Ask the user to enter two numbers (num1 and num2).

Perform the following arithmetic operations and print the results:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division (handle the case where num2 is zero to avoid division errors)

Task 3: Grading System

Ask the user to enter their score (as a float value).

Use conditional statements to assign a grade based on the score:

A: 90 and above

B: 80-89

C: 70-79

D: 60-69

F: below 60

Print the grade assigned.

Task 4: Functions with Lists

Create a function called calculate_average that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the average.

Test the function with the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and print the result.

Task 5: Error Handling in Functions

Create a function called divide_numbers that takes two arguments (num1 and num2).

Implement error handling in the function to handle division by zero (use a try-except block).

Ask the user to enter two numbers, call the divide_numbers function, and print the result.

Submission:

Submit your completed Python code, including all tasks, in a .py file or a Jupyter notebook. Make sure to include comments explaining your code where necessary.
