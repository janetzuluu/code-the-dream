## **Assignment: Data Analysis and Manipulation with Pandas**

### **Objective:**
In this assignment, you will explore the basic functionalities of the Pandas library in Python, including creating, manipulating, inspecting, and analyzing data using various DataFrame methods. The goal is to understand how to handle data efficiently and perform essential operations to inspect and analyze datasets.

### **Tasks:**

### **Task 1: Introduction to Pandas - Creating and Manipulating DataFrames**
1. **Create a DataFrame from a dictionary:**
   - Use a dictionary containing the following data:
     - `Name`: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
     - `Age`: [25, 30, 35]
     - `City`: ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
   - Convert the dictionary into a DataFrame using Pandas.
   - Print the DataFrame to verify its creation.

2. **Add a new column:**
   - Add a column called `Salary` with values `[70000, 80000, 90000]`.
   - Print the updated DataFrame.

3. **Modify an existing column:**
   - Increment the `Age` column by 1 for each entry.
   - Print the modified DataFrame to verify the changes.

### **Task 2: Loading Data from CSV, JSON, and Dictionaries**
1. **Read data from a CSV file:**
   - Create a sample CSV file using the DataFrame from Task 1.
   - Load the CSV file into a new DataFrame and print it.

2. **Read data from a JSON file:**
   - Create a JSON file containing sample data:
     - `Name`: 'Eve', 'Frank'
     - `Age`: 28, 40
     - `City`: 'Miami', 'Seattle'
   - Load the JSON file into a new DataFrame and print it.

3. **Revisit the original dictionary DataFrame:**
   - Print the DataFrame created from the original dictionary to verify its structure.

### **Task 3: Data Inspection - Using Head, Tail, and Info Methods**
1. **Use the `head()` method:**
   - Print the first 5 rows of the original dictionary DataFrame using the `head()` method.

2. **Use the `tail()` method:**
   - Print the last 2 rows of the original dictionary DataFrame using the `tail(2)` method.

3. **Use the `info()` method:**
   - Print a concise summary of the DataFrame using the `info()` method to understand the data types and non-null counts.

### **Task 4: Additional Data Inspection and Analysis**
1. **Determine the shape of the DataFrame:**
   - Use the `shape` attribute to print the number of rows and columns in the original DataFrame.

2. **Use the `describe()` method:**
   - Print a statistical summary of the numeric columns in the DataFrame, including count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles.

3. **Calculate the correlation matrix:**
   - Use the `corr()` method to print the correlation matrix of the numeric columns, indicating how the columns are related to each other.

### **Submission:**
- Save your completed code in a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook.
- Ensure that all tasks are correctly implemented and include comments to explain each step.
- Submit the code file as per your instructor's guidelines.
