# **Lesson 07: Introduction to Databases and SQL**

---

## **Task 1: Install Required Tools**
1. Install Python and verify the installation.
2. Set up a code editor for writing Python scripts.
3. Verify that SQLite is installed and accessible with Python.

---

## **Task 2: Create a New SQLite Database**
1. Create a new Python script file for this lesson.
2. Write code to connect to a new SQLite database.
3. Execute the script and confirm the database file is created.

---

## **Task 3: Define Database Structure**
1. Write SQL queries to create the following tables:
   - `Students`: Include fields for student ID, name, age, and major.
   - `Courses`: Include fields for course ID, course name, and instructor name.
   - `Enrollments`: Include fields for enrollment ID, student ID, and course ID.
2. Add the queries to your Python script.
3. Run the script to execute the queries and confirm the tables are created.

---

## **Task 4: Populate Tables with Data**
1. Write Python code to insert sample data into the `Students`, `Courses`, and `Enrollments` tables.
2. Add the insertion queries to your script and execute them.
3. Verify the data has been added by checking the database.

---

## **Task 5: Write SQL Queries**
1. Write a query to retrieve all student information from the `Students` table.
2. Write a query to find courses taught by a specific instructor.
3. Write a query to retrieve student enrollments along with course names using a `JOIN`.
4. Write a query to list students ordered by age.
5. Add these queries to your script and test their outputs.

---

## **Task 6: Commit Changes and Finalize**
1. Add code to commit changes to the database at the end of the script.
2. Close the database connection to finalize the operations.
3. Run the full script to ensure everything works as intended.
