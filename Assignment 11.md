## **Assignment 2: Customizing Plots**
1. Modify one of the plots created in Assignment 1 to include:
   - A different color palette.
   - Adjusted line styles or bar widths.
   - A customized grid.
2. Write a short explanation of how these customizations improve the plot's readability.

## **Assignment 3: Creating Advanced Visualizations with Seaborn**
1. Load the built-in Titanic dataset using Seaborn:
   ```python
   titanic = sns.load_dataset("titanic")
Create the following visualizations:
A heatmap showing correlations between numerical features.
A pair plot for selected columns (e.g., age, fare, and survived).
Save the visualizations as image files.
