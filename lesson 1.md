### Install Python

You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:

1. **For Windows**:
   - Download the latest version of Python for Windows from the Python official website.
   - Run the installer and make sure to **check the box to "Add Python to PATH"** during the installation process. This ensures that Python and `pip` (Python's package manager) will be available in your command prompt or terminal.
   - Choose the **"Install Now"** option to install Python with default settings, or use **"Customize Installation"** for more control over installation options.

2. **For macOS**:
   - macOS typically comes with Python pre-installed. To ensure you are using Python 3, download the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Follow the installation instructions. You can also use **Homebrew** to install Python by running the following command in the terminal:
     ```bash
     brew install python
     ```

3. **For Linux**:
   - Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. To install or upgrade Python 3, you can use the package manager:
     - For **Debian/Ubuntu** systems:
       ```bash
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install python3
       ```
     - For **Fedora**:
       ```bash
       sudo dnf install python3
       ```
     - For **Arch Linux**:
       ```bash
       sudo pacman -S python
       ```

4. **Verifying Python Installation**:
   After installation, you can verify that Python was installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:
   
   ```bash
   python --version
Or for Python 3 (in case of multiple Python versions):
```
python3 --version
```
This should display the installed version of Python. For example, you might see:
```
Python 3.9.7
```


### Install pip

**Pip** is Python’s package installer, and it is included automatically with Python versions 3.4 and above. It allows you to easily install and manage Python libraries and packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

#### Verify if pip is installed:
To check if **pip** is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
pip --version
```

If you're using **Python 3**, you might need to use `pip3` instead:

```bash
pip3 --version
```

This should display the installed version of pip. If pip is not installed or you encounter an error, you may need to reinstall Python and ensure that the box for **Add Python to PATH** is checked.

#### Upgrading pip:
If you already have pip installed but want to make sure it’s up to date, run the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Or, for Python 3:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### Using pip:
Once pip is installed, you can install Python packages by using the following command:

```bash
pip install package_name
```

Or, for Python 3:

```bash
pip3 install package_name
```

For example, to install the `requests` library (which allows you to make HTTP requests), you would use:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Or, for Python 3:

```bash
pip3 install requests
```

### Data Types in Python

**Data types** tell Python what kind of data is stored in a variable. Common data types include:

* Integer (`int`): Whole numbers (e.g., 42, -3)
* Float (`float`): Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5)
* String (`str`): Text (e.g., "hello", "world")
* Boolean (`bool`): Represents True or False values

```python
is_student = True       # Boolean
balance = 1000.75       # Float
first_name = "Charlie"  # String
number_of_days = 7      # Integer
```

You can check the type of a variable using the `type()` function:

```python
print(type(balance))  # Output: <class 'float'>
```

### Data Conversion

Data conversion, or **type casting**, is the process of converting one data type to another. Python provides several built-in functions to make this easy. Common conversion functions include `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, and `bool()`. Notice that these conversion functions line up with the data types demonstrated in the previous section.

```python
# Convert a string to an integer
num_str = "42"
num_int = int(num_str)  # 42 (integer)

# Convert an integer to a float
num_float = float(num_int)  # 42.0 (float)

# Convert a number to a string
num_str_again = str(num_int)  # "42" (string)

# Convert to a Boolean
is_empty = not bool("")  # True 
is_non_zero = bool(5)  # True (non-zero numbers are considered True)
```

#### Why Convert Data Types?

Data conversion is helpful when you need to perform operations between incompatible types or display values in specific formats. For instance, combining a number with text requires converting the number to a string.

```python
# Without type conversion
age = 30
message = "I am " + age + " years old."  # "TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str"
```

```python
# With type conversion
age = 30
message = "I am " + str(age) + " years old."  # "I am 30 years old."
```

#### Implicit vs. Explicit Conversion

Python sometimes performs **implicit conversion** (automatic type conversion), such as when adding an integer and a float, the result is automatically a float. However, for more control, it’s usually better to use **explicit conversion** with the functions above.

```python
# Implicit conversion
result = 3 + 2.5  # 5.5 (float, because Python converts the integer to float)

# Explicit conversion
result = int(2.8) + 3  # 5 (integer, because we explicitly converted the float to int)
```

### Operators in Python

**Operators** are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Some of the most commonly used operators are:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: For mathematical calculations
   * `+` (addition): `3 + 2` → `5`
   * `-` (subtraction): `5 - 3` → `2`
   * `*` (multiplication): `4 * 2` → `8`
   * `/` (division): `9 / 3` → `3.0`
   * `//` (integer division): `9 // 3` → `3`
   * `%` (modulus, remainder): `7 % 3` → `1`
   * `**` (exponentiation): `2 ** 3` → 8

2. **Comparison Operators**: Compare two values and return a Boolean (`True` or `False`)
   * `==` (equal to): `5 == 5` → `True`
   * `!=` (not equal to): `5 != 4` → `True`
   * `<` (less than): `3 < 4` → `True`
   * `>` (greater than): `10 > 5` → `True`
   * `<=` (less than or equal to): `5 <= 5` → `True`
   * `>=` (greater than or equal to): `7 >= 3` → `True`

3. **Logical Operators**: Used to combine conditional statements
   * `and`: `True and False` → `False`
   * `or`: `True or False` → `True`
   * `not`: `not True` → `False`

Operators Examples:

```python
# Arithmetic
result = 10 + 5  # 15
remainder = 9 % 4  # 1

# Comparison
print(5 > 3)  # True

# Logical
print(True and False)  # False
```

### Block structure in Python
## Overview

In Python, indentation plays a crucial role in the syntax of the language. Unlike many other programming languages, which use braces {} or other markers to denote code blocks, Python uses indentation to group statements and define the scope of loops, functions, classes, and conditional statements.

**Why Indentation Matters in Python**

* **Defining Code Blocks:** Indentation tells Python where a block of code begins and ends.
* **Enforcing Readability:** The clean and readable structure makes Python code easier to follow.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Indentation in Control Structures:** 
    * All code under control structures (such as `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and function definitions) must be indented.

* **Consistent Indentation:**
    * Consistency is key. Python does not allow mixing tabs and spaces. Use either spaces or tabs but never both. 
    * The Python community’s standard is to use 4 spaces per indentation level.

**Block Structure Example:**

```python
def check_number(num):
    if num > 0:
        print("Positive number")
    elif num < 0:
        print("Negative number")
    else:
        print("Zero")
```
In the above example:

The function check_number defines the first level of indentation.
The if, elif, and else blocks define additional indentation levels for the code that falls under each condition.
Indentation Error Example:


```python
def check_number(num):if num > 0:  # This will raise an error because it's not indented properly
    print("Positive number") 
```
In the above case, Python will raise an error stating: IndentationError: expected an indented block.

Using Indentation with Loops:

```python
for i in range(3):
    print("Loop iteration:", i)  # This line is inside the for loop
```
Any line that is indented under the for statement is part of the loop.


In many programming languages the format and structure makes code more easily readable.  Structure is even more critical in Python.  Read [this article from Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/indentation-in-python/) to gain an understanding of the importance of indentation, format, and structure when writing code blocks in Python.

## 1.2 Control Flow

Control flow structures allow us to direct the execution of code based on conditions or repeat code until a condition is met. The two main control flow structures in Python are **conditional statements** and **loops**.

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements enable code to execute only when specific conditions are met. Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to handle different conditions.

* `if`: Checks the initial condition. If `True`, it runs the code block.
* `else`: Runs if none of the previous conditions were `True`.
* `elif`: Stands for 'else if'; checks additional conditions if the previous ones were `False`.

```python
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You're an adult!")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You're a teenager.")
else:
    print("You're a child.")
```

#### Nested Conditionals

You can also nest conditionals inside each other for more complex decision-making.

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("A")
else:
    if score >= 80:
        print("B")
    else:
        print("C")
```

### Loops

**Loops** allow us to repeat code multiple times, either for a specific range or while a condition is `True`

#### `For` Loop

The `for` loop is commonly used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or range of numbers).

```python
# Looping through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Using range to loop a specific number of times
for i in range(3):
    print("Loop iteration:", i)
```

#### `While` Loop

A `while` loop runs as long as a condition remains `True`. Be careful to ensure the condition will eventually be `False` to avoid infinite loops.

```python
count = 0

while count < 3:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1
```

#### Breaking Out of Loops

The `break` statement can be used to exit a loop early.

```python
for num in range(10):
    if num == 5:
        break
    print(num)
# Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

#### Skipping Iterations

The `continue` statement allows you to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration and move to the next iteration.

```python
for num in range(5):
    if num == 2:
        continue
    print(num)
# Output: 0, 1, 3, 4
```

</details>

## 1.3 Functions

**Functions** are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help keep your code organized, modular, and easy to understand.

### Defining and Calling Functions

A function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by a function name, parentheses `()`, and a colon. The code inside the function is indented.

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

To call a function, simply use its name followed by parentheses.

```python
greet()  # Output: Hello, world!
```

### Parameters and Arguments

Functions can take **parameters** (variables defined within the parentheses in the function definition) to make them more versatile. When calling the function, you pass **arguments** (the actual values).

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
    
greet("Jazmine")  # Output: Hello, Jazmine!
```

You can also define multiple parameters.

```python
def add(a, b):
    print(a + b)

add(3, 5)  # Output: 8
```

### Return Values

A function can return a value to the caller using the `return` keyword. This makes the function's output available for use outside the function.

```python
def square(number):
    return number * number

result = square(4)  # result is 16
```

If a function doesn’t explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns `None`

### Default Parameters

You can set **default values** for parameters, making them optional when the function is called.

```python
def greet(name="stranger"):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet()            # Output: Hello, stranger!
greet("Luis")   # Output: Hello, Luis!
```

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

**Answer**: B) `"Hello, Luis!"`

</details>

## 1.4 Error Handling

Error handling in Python is managed using the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. This structure allows developers to gracefully handle errors that may occur during runtime, ensuring that the program can either recover from an issue or fail gracefully with useful feedback.

### `try` and `except`

The `try` block contains code that might raise an error. If an error occurs, the `except` block is executed, and Python will not terminate the program abruptly. You can catch specific exceptions or handle all exceptions generally.

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
```

```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### `else`

The `else` block is optional and runs if no exception was raised in the try block.

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
else:
    print(f"Success! The result is {result}.")
```

### `finally`

The `finally` block runs regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It’s often used for cleanup actions like closing files or database connections.

```python
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found.")
finally:
    file.close()
    print("File closed.")
```

### Raising exceptions

Python allows you to raise exceptions using the raise keyword, either with built-in exceptions or custom ones.

```python
def check_age(age):
    if age < 18:
        raise ValueError("Age must be 18 or older.")
    return True

try:
    check_age(16)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

### 1.4 Check for Understanding

**Question**: If the following code tries to divide by zero, which message will it print?

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
```

* A) It will print nothing
* B) `10`
* C) `Error: Division by zero is not allowed.`
* D) `None`

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Answer:** C) `Error: Division by zero is not allowed.`
</details>

### In-Depth Read: Errors and Exceptions

For a more in-depth look at Errors and Exceptions, along with plenty of examples, check out the [Python Tutorial's article on this subject](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html).

## 1.5 Basic Debugging

**Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing errors in your code. Two popular methods for basic debugging in Python are using **print statements** and **logging**.

### Debugging with Print Statements

Print statements are a simple way to check the values of variables and understand the flow of your program. This technique helps you see what’s happening at specific points in your code.

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    result = a * b
    print("Result is: ", result)  # Print to check the result
    return result

multiply(3, 5)  # Output: Result is: 15
```

Tips for effective print debugging:

* Use descriptive messages (e.g., `"Starting loop at i=" + str(i)`).
* Print variable values and descriptions of the program state.
* Remember to remove or comment out `print` statements when you’re done!

### Debugging with Logging

The **logging** module provides more control over output and is useful for larger projects or tracking complex issues. Unlike **print**, logging allows you to set levels to distinguish between informational messages, warnings, errors, and more.

Logging Levels

* **DEBUG**: Detailed information, typically useful only for debugging.
* **INFO**: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
* **WARNING**: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of future problems.
* **ERROR**: A serious problem that prevented some part of the code from running.

To use logging:

1. Import the `logging` module.
2. Set up basic configuration with `logging.basicConfig()`.
3. Use logging statements like `logging.debug()`, `logging.info()`, `logging.warning()`, and `logging.error()`.

Here's an example of using logging for debugging. Notice how each of the three steps are incorporated.

```python
# Step 1
import logging

# Step 2
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Step 3
def multiply(a, b):
    logging.debug(f"Multiplying {a} and {b}")
    result = a * b
    logging.info(f"Result is: {result}")
    return result

multiply(3, 5)
```
